# Rotational-VideoCam
Xcode project to simultaneously record video and gyroscopic data

### App Instructions 
The app is simple: press the **red square** in the lefthand corner of the screen to begin recording visual and rotational information (accessed through the device gyroscope) and tap again to finish. Save both the video and CSV file to a memorable location. The CSV file also contains the _timestamps_ of the rotational information when recorded. 

### Instructions to Import
Before importing, please check that your device and Xcode versions matches those of mine:
- iOS Version: **15.5**
- Xcode Version: **13.4**

Importing the project is simple: open your native Xcode and select _Open a Project or File_, then select the contained Xcode project file.
